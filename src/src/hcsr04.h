/*
 * What is this constant?
 * 
 * Well, hcsr04_get_micros() returns microseconds, but we need centimeters in hcsr04_get_cm(). How to do that?
 * Speed of sound in air (20 Â°C) is 343 m/s, which is 34300 cm/s, which is 0.0343 cm/us. This value has to be divided by 2, 
 * because the echo duration is the time sound needs to go both directions -> the final constant is 0.01715.
 * Now, the only think we have to do is multiply the echo value by this constant.
